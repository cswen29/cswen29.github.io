## Final Project Documentation 

From my [final project proposal](https://github.com/cswen29/ITP/tree/main/final/final%20project%20proposal), I followed most of my guidelines like: it being my portfolio, it has my sound design reel page, Video prdouction stuff (Directing, Filming, Editing), it has my social media links, and at this stage, im about to add in my resume, debug some front end stuff and make it even nicer. 

So far, the interactiveness I have in my website includes the hover feature, parallax scrolling effect and a Contact Me section, although I don't really like the outlook of that just yet. I am about to include more animation and linear gradient with my sticky navigating top bar. Currently, the navigation bar is in a fixed position instead of sticky, so I will work on changing that.  

Other than that, I learned that website loading speed is really important and that I have to keep it as efficient as possible, however currently my goal is just to make it look nice and add lots of content. 

I researched on more interactive sites, [article](https://rockcontent.com/blog/how-to-make-interactive-website/#:~:text=An%20interactive%20website%20is%20simply,the%20use%20of%20interactive%20elements.)
