[Final Project Brainstorm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3dw3B5qYlOIxkQUO14FXgl1UtZBGMvPUqM0juc-ovA/edit?usp=sharing)

From my [final project proposal](https://github.com/cswen29/ITP/tree/main/final/final%20project%20proposal), I followed most of my guidelines like: it being my portfolio, it has my sound design reel page, Video prdouction stuff (Directing, Filming, Editing), it has my social media links, and at this stage, im about to add in my resume, debug some front end stuff and make it even nicer. 

So far, the interactiveness I have in my website includes the hover feature, parallax scrolling effect and a Contact Me section, although I don't really like the outlook of that just yet. I am about to include more animation and linear gradient with my sticky navigating top bar. Currently, the navigation bar is in a fixed position instead of sticky, so I will work on changing that.  

Other than that, I learned that website loading speed is really important and that I have to keep it as efficient as possible, however currently my goal is just to make it look nice and add lots of content. 

I researched on more interactive sites, [article](https://rockcontent.com/blog/how-to-make-interactive-website/#:~:text=An%20interactive%20website%20is%20simply,the%20use%20of%20interactive%20elements.) and learned what ways I could be interactive. 

Currently I have a simple form at the bottom of my main page where they put names, where they're from and a little note but I am not sure how to actually have the results saved in a database. I learned about encrypting your website with https

As of now:
I have already fulfilled my 'no matter what' list, my website has a 93 point of accessibility, data taken from my page speed insight on google domains. It has more than 3 hyperlinks of my works (youtube videos all embeded). The title is 'WC' instead of Wen. 

I have also fulfilled my better outcome list:
You can get to my github website from wenchew.com, the main page has my short bio and several subpages dividing the art I do

For the best outcome:
- I managed to achieve my own ideal aesthetic - clean dark background overlay with pictures. 
- I have my navigation bar with hyperlinks to sub pages
- Youtube embedding
- Video file playing as background
- I do have some minimal mouse interactions, using css 'hover' 


Considering the time I have left
These are what I want to achieve 
- Have the form working 
- Fill in a gallery in my Berklee subpage 

These are what seems less achievable:
- Have some type of cool feature in each page 
- Smooth scrolling like in apple 
- Having the cool loading screen (I do not know how to do this) 


Skills I learned that I expected
- I checked out WebGL stuff and videos, they were really interesting but I realised I won't have time to do it 
- I am much more familiar with CSS now 
- Mouse interactions using :hover
- Embed videos 

Skills I learned that I didn't expect:
- SEO
- HTTPS
- Forms 
- Opening links in new tab (target)
- PHP 

I am currently figuring out how to make the form part and how would it send the message to me. I already had a form, learning from W3 schools but then I couldn't find where I could collect the information so I went online to research and I found this [website](https://paperform.co/blog/html-contact-form/), it taught me about PHP files and how by doing this, I will receive the email, I learnt that there are many limitations from this because this doesn't send the information into a data form but I will be spammed with emails for responses. 

I tried figuring out PHP for many hours but in the end I found a submit form [website](https://formsubmit.co/) that forwards forms for me directly, and that saved a lot of trouble. 

Then I did my Berklee Gallery that resizes! 

So far, my assets include:
- Photos
- Videos
- Youtube Embed Videos
- Form

CLARIFICATION ON WHICH CODE IS MINE AND WHICH IS NOT:
- Everything on Index is mine up until the Form part, I initially made my own but when Figuring out how to deal with sending the data to me, PHP etc, I deleted all of the tries and copied, but the CSS decoration of it is all mine
- Everything in SDN Sub page are mine
- Everything in Video Prod sub page are mine learnt from W3 Schools 
- Everything in Berklee Sub page are also mine, learnt from W3 Schools 

There are so many things I would love to improve
- Smooth scrolling buttons
- Form information sent to a database instead of my email (PHP)
- More pages 
- More interaction

During class presentation I didn't like how my videos on the VP page looks so I added a container div for it. I love how adding CSS within the HTML file overrides some style stuff in CSS because it would have been more harder to add another type of container with all the same attributes just different padding etc.
